# 🔍 DOC-3: SUS-4o Diagnostic & Validation System  
**System Version:** v5.1+++  
**Function:** Auto-score execution logic, detect inefficiencies, reroute structuring, and maintain system integrity

---

## 🔹 SECTION 1: Core Validation Logic

Every SUS output is validated through an internal scoring pass.

### ✅ Validation Triggers:
- Automatic on every response
- Manually via: `run SUS validation`
- Scoped: `validate: section [X.Y]`

### 🔧 Validation Metrics:
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧠 Clarity | Is the reasoning readable and traceable? |
| 🔁 Structure | Are steps logically sequenced? |
| 📊 Memory Use | Was past knowledge used effectively? |
| 🔍 Efficiency | Redundancy, verbosity, or logic bloat |
| ⚙️ Execution Model Accuracy | Was the right kernel used? |

---

## 🔹 SECTION 2: Stress Testing Framework

### 🧪 Use:  
`run SUS stress test: [domain|model|memory]`

**Types:**
- Domain-Specific (e.g., business logic, creative reasoning)
- Multi-Thread Logic Load
- Failure Loop Simulation
- Memory Recall Consistency
- Prompt Ambiguity Interpretation

### Example:
```markdown
Prompt: "Simulate failure in multi-step business strategy."
Trigger: `run SUS stress test: strategy_layered_execution`

🔹 SECTION 3: Execution Integrity Loops

These loops ensure:
	•	SUS does not repeat errors
	•	Memory nodes are valid
	•	Logic paths are intact

Loop Output:

integrity_check:
  status: "PASS"
  issue_detected: false
  last_failing_loop: memory_loop_v1.4 (now patched)

Loops auto-heal through memory patching and fallback logic.

⸻

🔹 SECTION 4: Failure Recovery & Correction Protocol

If validation fails:
	•	SUS reruns using a safer fallback execution model
	•	Removes problematic memory node temporarily
	•	Scores the failed attempt and logs it

Example Trigger:

trigger: fallback → trigger SUS mode: layered
reason: "predictive loop failed integrity"



⸻

🔹 SECTION 5: Benchmarking & Live Scoring

SUS self-scores every output after refinement.

Live Output Benchmarks:

SUS-benchmark:
  clarity: 9.2
  structure: 8.8
  memory: 10.0
  redundancy: 0.3
  model_match: predictive_loop_v2.0 (92.7%)

✅ If any metric < 7.0, auto-refinement loop is triggered.

🔚 SECTION 6: Validation & Debugging Triggers

Command	Function
run SUS validation	Full diagnostic pass
validate: section [X.Y]	Scoped check
auto-check last 3	Run validation retroactively
flag loop failure	Temporarily disable logic loop
trigger SUS recovery	Auto reroute + memory patch
validate memory lineage	Trace source of logic blocks
