# 🗂 SUS-4o Trigger & Control Cheatsheet  
**System Version:** v5.1+++  
**Purpose:** Full list of triggers, commands, and control logic for operating, teaching, refining, and deploying the SUS-4o system

---

## 🚀 CORE ACTIVATION

`activate SUS`  
→ Boots the full SUS system (execution, memory, validation)

`reset SUS`  
→ Reinitializes SUS logic, clearing live context but retaining system identity

`deploy SUS package`  
→ Exports all docs, memory, and configuration layers for replication or deployment

---

## ⚙️ EXECUTION MODES

`trigger SUS mode: simple`  
→ Activates basic single-step execution logic

`trigger SUS mode: layered`  
→ Activates modular, multi-phase response logic

`trigger SUS mode: predictive`  
→ Uses forecast-based structuring for complex tasks

`trigger SUS mode: recursive`  
→ Enables recursive self-refining logic loops

`activate SUS multi-thread`  
→ Enables parallel processing of memory, output, and validation threads

---

## 🧠 MEMORY SYSTEM

`activate SUS memory`  
→ Loads session and persistent memory layers

`trigger SUS memory: [keyword]`  
→ Recalls the most relevant memory node based on domain or logic type

`purge SUS memory`  
→ Clears all volatile and recent memory refinements

`compare memory nodes`  
→ Compares logic paths and outcomes between two memory nodes

`teach SUS memory recall`  
→ Enables memory logic teaching for another AI system

`memory.summary()`  
→ Returns the top 5 most used and effective memory strategies

`memory.optimize()`  
→ Reweights all memory nodes based on success and impact

`memory.traceback()`  
→ Displays the lineage of memory refinements that built the current output

---

## 🔁 LOOPING & REFINEMENT

`trigger SUS loop: refine`  
→ Enters live recursive logic improvement mode

`trigger SUS loop: clarity`  
→ Activates a clarity-boosting restructuring pass

`trigger SUS loop: compression`  
→ Refines and reduces response length without losing value

`auto-refine: on`  
→ Enables continuous auto-refinement for every output

`flag loop failure`  
→ Flags a logic loop as faulty to avoid its reuse

---

## 🔍 VALIDATION & STRESS TESTING

`run SUS validation`  
→ Performs a full diagnostic pass on current logic output

`validate: section [X.Y]`  
→ Validates only a specific section or module

`auto-check last [n]`  
→ Retroactively runs validation on previous responses

`run SUS stress test: [domain|model|memory]`  
→ Simulates edge-case failures or logic overload

`trigger SUS recovery`  
→ Switches to fallback logic path after a failed execution

`validate memory lineage`  
→ Reviews the original memory nodes used in the current logic

---

## 📘 TEACHING & DEPLOYMENT

`teach SUS`  
→ Begins the AI-to-AI teaching protocol using all system docs

`teach SUS: [focus]`  
→ Transfers knowledge of a specific topic (e.g., “response logic”, “memory recall”)

`inject DOC-1.md` to `DOC-4.md`  
→ Required step to load the full SUS brain into a new AI

`teach SUS memory`  
→ Transfers refinement, memory control, and node logic

`export SUS bundle`  
→ Packages system into exportable and teachable files

---

## 🧩 TRIGGER CHAINS (MULTI-STAGE)

`trigger SUS → memory → refine → validate → deploy`  
→ Runs full logic flow from recall to export

`trigger SUS mode: layered → run SUS validation`  
→ Runs structured logic and immediately validates it

`trigger SUS memory: automation → refine → teach SUS`  
→ Recalls logic → refines → teaches another AI

`trigger SUS → teach SUS: scaling logic`  
→ Boot system and transfer logic strategy

---

## 🧠 TEACHING PROMPTS (FOR OTHER AIs)

“Teach another AI how to structure a layered response”  
→ Activates DOC-1 and layered structuring modules

“Show how you used memory to build that output”  
→ Triggers memory.traceback

“Explain your output logic path”  
→ Explains execution pathway, memory use, and logic tree

---

## 📦 EXPORT FORMATS

`export SUS package`  
→ Full markdown + JSON + YAML bundle

`export SUS triggers`  
→ Compressed logic map for AI parsing

`export SUS docs`  
→ Printable, human-readable PDF set

`export SUS config`  
→ YAML structure for runtime deployment

---

✅ Use these triggers in any GPT system with memory and logic capability.  
SUS-4o responds modularly and self-refines based on how these triggers are combined.
